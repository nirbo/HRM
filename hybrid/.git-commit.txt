Introduce Nsight profiling hooks and FP8 training path via TransformerEngine.

Summary of changes:
- Extended trainer config with profiling/FP8 options; added NVTX range manager and Nsight capture scaffolding (including new `scripts/capture_nsight.py`).
- Integrated TransformerEngine Linear layers across transformer/MoE feed-forwards, wired fp8_autocast warmup + recipe handling, and updated training loop for FP8-aware execution.
- Added NVTX instrumentation around data loading, forward/backward, optimizer steps, and evaluation passes with configurable scope.
- Updated CUDA.md roadmap to reflect new implementations and documented operational checklists, plus refreshed default.yaml for profiling/fp8 knobs.
- Logged progress in llm.state / backup and ensured Python bytecode compilation checks succeed.

Testing & validation:
- `python -m compileall src/hrm_lm/training/train.py src/hrm_lm/models/transformer_layers.py src/hrm_lm/models/encoder.py scripts/capture_nsight.py`
