Refine trainer logging colors and suppress transformer warning

Summary
- Swapped training/eval Rich colors for darker palette, shortened metric labels, and removed bright/white tones.
- Added warnings filter plus boolean masks to silence Nested Tensor warnings without changing behaviour.
- Disabled nested tensor usage in custom transformer layers and ensured speed formatting stays on one line.
- Verified via dry run, synthetic run, and pytest.
