Title: Default QA normalization to plain question/answer

Summary:
- Change scripts/normalize_qa_dataset.py to output prompts as raw questions and responses as raw answers by default (still configurable when context is needed).
- Update TRAINING.md to explain the new defaults and how to include context explicitly.
- Log the change in llm.state.

Files Touched:
- scripts/normalize_qa_dataset.py
- TRAINING.md
- llm.state
- .git-commit.txt
- llm.state.bak (local backup, untracked)

Validation:
- (No code execution required beyond existing tests).

Follow-ups:
- Regenerate normalized datasets to remove old "Question:/Answer:" scaffolding before the next training pass.
