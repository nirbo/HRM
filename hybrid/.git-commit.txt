Title: Clear stale extra eval slices and add pytorch-optimizer dependency

Summary:
- Added pytorch-optimizer to the training environment so future trainer integrations can reference the library without extra setup.
- Cleared the default extra_eval_slices list in moe.yaml to stop warning spam when the referenced datasets are absent, leaving commented examples for reference.
- Updated the statefile with the latest research planning notes ahead of the pytorch-optimizer integration work.

Testing:
- No tests executed (configuration-only changes).
