Title: Adjust RWKV7 schedule for batch 8 accum 4 training

Summary:
- drop training batch size to 8, set grad_accum_steps=4, and align eval batch size in rwkv7_lora config.
- recompute warmup/stable/decay steps to 31/127/62 for 7,060-sample split under effective batch 32.

Testing:
- n/a (config-only change)
