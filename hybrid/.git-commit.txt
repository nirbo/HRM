Add progress bar to dataset converter

Summary
- Wrapped the parquet-to-token pipeline with a Rich progress bar that tracks files processed and samples emitted.
- Printed a completion summary and listed `pyarrow`/`pandas` as explicit dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

Files
- scripts/prepare_language_dataset.py — progress visualization and summary print.
- requirements.txt — added conversion dependencies (and noted optional causal-conv1d).
