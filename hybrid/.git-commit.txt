Title: Store checkpoints in per-step directories

Summary:
- Save each checkpoint into its own step_{NNNNNN}/ directory containing model.pt, config.yaml, and copied tokenizer/meta artifacts.
- Adjust resume/rotation logic to work with directories and provide a "No checkpoint found" message on fresh runs.
- Update best/final checkpoint handling to use generic filenames and ensure artifacts live alongside them.
- Log the change in llm.state.

Files Touched:
- src/hrm_lm/training/train.py
- llm.state
- .git-commit.txt
- llm.state.bak (local backup, untracked)

Validation:
- python -m compileall src/hrm_lm/training/train.py
- Quick smoke run (`--run_name tmp-test`) verifying new directory structure.

Follow-ups:
- None.
