Add per-slice validation logging for HRM training runs

Summary:
- load optional extra evaluation slices from the training config and surface descriptive warnings for misconfigured entries.
- factor shared validation logic into run_eval_pass so main and per-slice evaluations share batching, truncation, and NVTX behaviours.
- emit labelled per-slice validation metrics every eval interval while preserving early-stop tracking on the primary dataset only.
- extend moe.yaml with the updated HRM halting parameters and enumerate the ten component datasets so per-source metrics are available out of the box.
- append detailed session notes to llm.state capturing analysis, plan, staging, and tooling steps for traceability.

Tests:
- python -m compileall src/hrm_lm/training/train.py
