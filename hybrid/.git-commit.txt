Add dataset mixing mode for Stage B merge workflow

- extend scripts/merge_prepared_batches.py with weighted mixing support for processed datasets (train/val targets, oversampling small corpora)
- refresh REASON-TRAINING.md to document the new --sources/--weights --output command with optional ScienceQA mix
- record script/runbook updates in llm.state for reproducibility
