Enable JSONL dataset training in trainer

Summary
- Added helpers to load tokenized datasets from `train.jsonl`/`val.jsonl` directories and stream batches with the existing `pad_batch` routine.
- Trainer now accepts a dataset path (instead of only `synthetic`) and reports training sample counts, while still supporting the synthetic fallback.
- Updated masking to use boolean tensors and reuse iterable batch loaders for validation.

Files
- src/hrm_lm/training/train.py â€” JSONL loader, dataset iterator, CLI handling.
