# Task State

## Recent Adjustments
- Trainer logging now prints loss/grad/lr with 15 decimal places and formats ETA as `NNh:NNm`.
- Dataset converter already supports multi-threaded batching (per previous update).

## Session 2025-09-18T02:06Z
### Original Task Description
- Investigate why learning rate stays constant after 500-step warmup and switch default scheduler to cosine with CLI selection option.

### Plan
1. Inspect current training scheduler implementation to confirm warmup and decay behavior.
2. Identify configuration entry points for default scheduler and CLI arguments.
3. Modify code to default to cosine scheduler post-warmup while supporting user-selected schedulers via CLI.
4. Review code comments, documentation, and tests to ensure consistency.
5. Validate changes conceptually and note any pending verification tasks.

## Session 2025-09-19T04:12Z
### Original Task Description
- Read through the current directories contents and code to get in-context and up to speed, strictly following AGENTS.md, and report when up to speed.

### Plan
1. Capture repository top-level structure to understand available components.
2. Review AGENTS.md and any mandatory guidelines to ensure compliance.
3. Identify key documentation (README, TRAINING, docs) for high-level context.
4. Survey crucial source directories (especially `src`) to map modules and responsibilities.
5. Summarize current understanding and outstanding questions before reporting readiness.

### Pending Steps
- None; plan complete.

### Current Summary
- HRM-LM stack confirmed: transformer/mamba encoder feeds HRMCore with gating, halting, and deep supervision hooks into transformer decoder.
- Training pipeline streams JSONL datasets with checkpoint artifact management; inference CLI auto-loads configs/tokenizers with device resolution.
- Tests exercise hybrid forward pass, bridge modes, and GPU memory comparisons; remaining step is to compile readiness summary.

### Open Issues
- None identified.

### Task Completion Summary
- Extended trainer retry loop to flush CUDA state and retry once when cuBLAS errors arise during mixed-precision training.
- Verified trainer compiles after the change and captured guidance to monitor resumed runs for repeated cuBLAS retries.
- Logged the update in state tracking so future sessions know that cuBLAS handling is now in place.

## Session 2025-09-19T17:42Z
### Original Task Description
- Diagnose runtime failure during training: `RuntimeError: CUDA error: CUBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` raised at `loss.backward()` around step 90467/233896 with bf16 mixed precision.

### Plan
1. Capture failure context from trainer implementation around `loss.backward()` to understand existing safeguards.
2. Review current mixed-precision and retry logic to see how CUDA errors are handled and identify gaps.
3. Propose actionable mitigation steps for the user (configuration tweaks or code adjustments) to prevent CUBLAS internal errors.

- 2025-09-19T17:50Z: Ran `git diff -- src/hrm_lm/training/train.py` to review changes; command succeeded.

### Pending Steps
- None; plan complete.

### Current Summary
- Trainer retry loop now flushes caches and retries once when cuBLAS errors surface during bf16 autocast runs.
- Validation via compileall confirms syntax, and guidance will recommend monitoring retried steps during resumed training.

### Open Issues
- Monitor upcoming training logs to ensure the new cuBLAS retry path succeeds without repeated failures.

### Task Completion Summary
- Pending task execution.

## Session 2025-09-19T23:37Z
### Original Task Description
- Investigate incoherent generations from `runs/english-pretrain-2/best-model/model.pt` despite recent training; gradient spikes observed near step 231k/233k.

### Pending Steps
- Step 3: Diagnose inference quality and recommend next steps.

### Current Summary
- Best-model directory contains config/tokenizer/meta artifacts; saved snapshot predates visible gradient explosion but still yields incoherent generations.
- No persisted training logs available under run directory, so gradient spike context must rely on console history.
- Trainer code (`src/hrm_lm/training/train.py:744-762`) proves best-model saving strictly depends on eval loss improvements; issue likely stems from validation metric not reflecting downstream coherence.

### Open Issues
- None yet.

## Session 2025-09-21T01:08Z
### Original Task Description
- Diagnose and resolve the JSON decode failure encountered while streaming the validation split during `python -m hrm_lm.training.train`.

### Plan
1. Review high-level project context (README, training docs) to refresh assumptions about dataset format expectations.
2. Inspect `src/hrm_lm/training/train.py` dataset loading utilities, focusing on JSONL parsing and multiprocessing flow.
3. Sample lines from `datasets/wiki_chunks/processed/val.jsonl` near the reported failure offset to verify JSON integrity.
4. Identify the precise root cause and outline remediation steps (code fix, data correction, or configuration tweak).

### Pending Steps
- None; plan complete.

### Current Summary
- Added trainer flags for patience grace, HRM gate warmup, and LR floors while preparing to relaunch with a rebuilt dataset (0.5% validation split).

### Open Issues
- Await completion of the new dataset split and rerun quick JSON validation before training.
- Re-launch `wikipedia-train-3` with updated flags (patience grace, gate warmup, LR floor) and monitor early-stop behaviour.
- Decide when to enable HRM deep supervision/halting during the curriculum stages.

### Task Completion Summary
- Diagnosed validation loader failure: `val.jsonl` line 3144 is truncated (missing closing brackets/newline), causing `json.loads` to raise `Expecting ',' delimiter` during `_parse_json_line`.
- Recommended remediation: regenerate or repair the validation dataset (drop or reconstruct the malformed entry, refresh metadata) and optionally guard `_parse_json_line` with try/except to skip/log corrupt samples.
- Implemented patience grace, HRM gate warmup, and learning-rate floor controls plus gate-scaling buffer support for staged HRM training.
