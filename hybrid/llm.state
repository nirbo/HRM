# Task State

## Completed Actions
- Added Rich-based progress visualization to `scripts/prepare_language_dataset.py`, showing file and sample counts while streaming parquet shards.
- Script now prints a final summary of train/val sample counts and writes metadata as before.
- Declared `pyarrow>=14` and `pandas>=2.3` in requirements so dataset conversion dependencies are explicit.

## Verification
- Not rerun on full dataset to avoid heavy I/O (logic-only change).
