# Task State

## Original Task
Have a look at the code in the cwd, then read through docs/HRM_LM_Integration_Design.md. Understand the design document without modifying it and determine whether it is sufficiently comprehensive to implement from.

## Plan
1. Review repository contents within `hybrid` to understand available code and resources.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` to ensure all operating constraints are understood and recorded.
3. Study `docs/HRM_LM_Integration_Design.md` in detail, capturing key components and open questions.
4. Evaluate whether the design document is comprehensive enough for implementation and prepare the response for the user.

## Progress Tracker
- Completed Steps: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4
- Current Step: None — awaiting user feedback
- Pending Steps: None

## Pending Steps
None — awaiting next instructions.

## Current Summary
Document delivers a structured roadmap (architecture overview, staged diffs, testing, risks) that is broadly adequate for implementation. Identified two clarifications to close: expose BOS/EOS handles (or adjust usage) in the tokenizer/generation plan, and spell out the exact halting-loss wiring so implementers know where `halting_weight` and targets live.

## Unresolved Issues
- `SimpleTokenizer` snippet lacks an exposed `BOS`/`EOS` attribute while `generate()` expects `tokenizer.BOS`, which will currently fall back to a hard-coded `1` (lines noted in the report).
- Halting regularizer is described conceptually but the patch location and target value remain unspecified, risking divergent implementations.
