# Task State

## Recent Adjustments
- Trainer logging now prints loss/grad/lr with 15 decimal places and formats ETA as `NNh:NNm`.
- Dataset converter already supports multi-threaded batching (per previous update).

## Session 2025-09-18T02:06Z
### Original Task Description
- Investigate why learning rate stays constant after 500-step warmup and switch default scheduler to cosine with CLI selection option.

### Plan
1. Inspect current training scheduler implementation to confirm warmup and decay behavior.
2. Identify configuration entry points for default scheduler and CLI arguments.
3. Modify code to default to cosine scheduler post-warmup while supporting user-selected schedulers via CLI.
4. Review code comments, documentation, and tests to ensure consistency.
5. Validate changes conceptually and note any pending verification tasks.

- 2025-09-18T02:16Z: Restaged `llm.state` after logging staging action.

### Pending Steps
- None; plan complete.

### Current Summary
- All plan steps complete; scheduler options implemented, documented, and sanity-checked.

### Open Issues
- Consider future runtime validation on real training runs (out of scope for this session).

### Task Completion Summary
- Added CLI `--lr_scheduler` with default cosine decay and corresponding logic in `src/hrm_lm/training/train.py`.
- Updated `TRAINING.md` to describe scheduler options and adjusted warmup guidance.
- Validated syntax and scheduler behavior via compile and simulation; recommend running a short training job to observe LR logs end-to-end.
