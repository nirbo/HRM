Original Task Description:
- Investigate why RWKV7 HRM fine-tuned model generation outputs <unk> tokens; ensure tokenizer loads correctly and generation works.

Plan:
1. Review AGENTS.md and relevant documentation to refresh architecture-specific constraints. [completed]
2. Inspect inference configuration and tokenizer loading flow to identify cause of <unk> outputs. [completed]
3. Implement targeted fixes and update documentation or configs as needed. [in_progress]
4. Validate generation output with updated setup and record findings. [pending]

Action Log:
- Initialized state tracking file.
- Updated execution plan after invoking planning tool.
- Reviewed AGENTS.md header content for governing rules (sed -n '1,120p' AGENTS.md).
- Examined best-model config export (sed -n '1,160p' runs/rwkv7-hrm-gsm8k/best-model/config.yaml).
- Inspected inference generator logic including tokenizer loader (sed -n '1,400p' src/hrm_lm/inference/generate.py).
- Investigated training metadata and tokenizer assets (cat runs/rwkv7-hrm-gsm8k/best-model/meta.json; head tokenizer_rwkv7_vocab.json).
- Reviewed RWKV tokenizer implementation to understand available encode/decode hooks (sed -n '1,200p' src/hrm_lm/tokenizers/rwkv.py).

Pending Steps:
- Step 3 in progress.
- Step 4 pending execution.

Current State Summary:
- Determined generator falls back to synthetic/simple tokenizer because checkpoint lacks tokenizer.json; meta.json points to RWKV vocabulary in custom format requiring dedicated loader.

Issues / Risks:
- Need to extend inference tooling to load RWKV vocabulary and provide decode functionality; ensure adapters avoid introducing regressions for HF tokenizers.
