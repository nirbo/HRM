Enable halting by default in configs

- Switch `use_halting` to true in `configs/default.yaml` so fresh runs exercise the stabilized halting pathway without manual overrides.
- Captured the follow-up workflow in `hybrid/llm.state`, including config verification and branch housekeeping steps.
- Added the latest statefile backup to keep session history synced with the repository log.
