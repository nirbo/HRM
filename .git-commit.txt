Reconcile HRM gating safeguards with upstream NaN handling

- Sanitized the HRM bridge by clamping gate scales, zeroing non-finite logits/memory tensors, and guarding the halting penalty so upstream safeguards and warmup gating no longer conflict.
- Extended the optional Mamba2 stack and transformer fallback to apply `torch.nan_to_num` after every recurrent update and residual merge, mirroring the newly merged runtime protections.
- Logged the conflict-resolution workflow in `hybrid/llm.state` so future sessions can trace the stabilization steps and pending verification tasks.
